# DuoClock

DuoClock is a simple, stylish analog and digital clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Rotating analog clock with hour, minute, and second hands
- Real-time digital time display with hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM
- Smooth animations and modern neumorphic design
- Fully responsive and uses Google Fonts (Poppins)

## How it Works

The clock uses JavaScript’s `Date` object to get the current time every second. The analog hands are rotated using CSS transforms, and the digital time is updated by modifying the inner HTML of corresponding elements.

## Usage

Just open the HTML file in a browser — the clock will display the current local time in both analog and digital formats.

## Customization

- You can change colors by editing the CSS variables (`--clr`).
- Change fonts by modifying the Google Fonts link.
- Adjust sizes in the CSS to fit your preference.
